                            effort aimed at ending racial discrimination and
                            achieving equal rights for African Americans, remains one of the most defining and
                            influential chapters in U.S. history. Spanning the 1950s and 1960s, this movement
                            fundamentally reshaped the nation’s legal and social landscape, culminating in landmark
                            legislation that sought to dismantle decades of racial segregation and systemic injustice.

                        <p class="news-text pt-10"> The struggle for civil rights began long before the 1950s, but the
                            post-World War II era
                            provided new momentum for change. African Americans, many of whom had fought for democracy
                            abroad, returned home to a nation that denied them basic rights. This glaring contradiction
                            fueled a growing push for equality that would eventually lead to one of the most sustained
                            and visible movements in modern history.</p>

                        <p class="news-text pt-10"> One of the most iconic moments of the Civil Rights Movement occurred in
                            December 1955 when Rosa Parks, an African American seamstress, refused to give up her seat
                            to a white man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Parks’ arrest sparked the
                            Montgomery Bus Boycott, a year-long protest that would become a pivotal moment in the fight
                            for civil rights.

                            was a strategic effort to challenge the city’s segregation laws. African Americans, who made
                            up the majority of the city’s bus riders, refused to use the buses, causing financial strain
                            on the public transportation system. After 381 days of protests, the Supreme Court ruled
                            that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional, marking a major victory for the
                            movement.

                            among younger activists. One of the most notable developments was the sit-in movement, which
                            began in 1960 when four African American college students in Greensboro, North Carolina,
                            refused to leave a segregated lunch counter after being denied service. Their peaceful
                            protest sparked a wave of sit-ins across the South, as students and activists challenged
                            segregation in public places such as restaurants, libraries, and parks.

                            segregated interstate bus travel. In 1961, groups of black and white activists, known as
                            Freedom Riders, rode buses through the South to test a Supreme Court ruling that banned
                            segregation in interstate travel facilities. The riders were often met with violent
                            resistance, but their courage and determination brought national attention to the movement
                            and the brutal realities of segregation.

                            D.C., for the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It was here that Martin
                            Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic "I Have a Dream" speech, calling for an end to racism
                            and envisioning a future where people would be judged by their character rather than the

                            question the effectiveness of nonviolent protest. By the late 1960s, more militant voices,
                            such as those of the Black Power movement, gained prominence, calling for a more radical
                            approach to achieving racial justice.
